# @xstate/vue

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8662e543`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/commit/8662e543393de7e2f8a6d92ff847043781d10f4d) [#1317](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/pull/1317) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - `useMachine` and `useService` cant be now parametrized with a `TTypestate` parameter which makes leveraging typestates possible on their returned values.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`65c13245`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/commit/65c132458cdc73b242f9c0b22e61ba9ba7780509) [#1253](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/pull/1253) Thanks [@darrenjennings](https://github.com/darrenjennings)! - Upgraded package for compatibility with the newest `@vue/composition-api@^0.6.0`, which means that a peer dependency requirement has changed to this version, which is a **breaking change**. The only observable behavior change is that exposed refs are now **shallow**.

## 0.1.1
